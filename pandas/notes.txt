When working through, get filters setup for specific type of ship then you can swap around locations and blanks to speed up the workflow

1) Filter for Grainger/Amazon and the according type of shipment (IE: Drop ship in time, DC in time, Drop ship late ...)
2) Filter for "Days Before Late" according to workload
3) Filter out WIP/Blank (this step is flipped for the "needs review report")
4) Filter for SW or DY
5) Copy UID to printed sheet
6) Copy Columns A-T into the Access Model
7) Print to PDF with name like "Priority/Late_DC(if applicable)_Warehouse
    ex: Priority_DC_SW
    ex: Late_LNR
8) Make note of whats complete so far
    - Make sure all areas are covered
        - Grainger, Amazon AND all other customers
        - In time and late shipments
