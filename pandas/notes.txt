When working through, get filters setup for specific type of ship then you can swap around locations and blanks to speed up the workflow

1) Filter for Grainger/Amazon and the according type of shipment (IE: Drop ship in time, DC in time, Drop ship late ...)
2) Filter for "Days Before Late" according to workload
3) Filter out WIP/Blank (this step is flipped for the "needs review report")
4) Filter for any already printed
5) Filter for SW or DY
6) Copy UID to printed sheet
7) Copy Columns A-T into the Access Model
8) Print to PDF with name like "Priority/Late_DC(if applicable)_Warehouse
    ex: Priority_DC_SW
    ex: Late_LNR
9) Make note of whats complete so far
    - Make sure all areas are covered
        - Grainger, Amazon, MSC Industrial AND all other customers
        - Branch, Drop Shop, DC
        - In time and late shipments
