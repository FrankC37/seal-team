# Warehouse Manager Meeting
    


Product from QC that Anna cant ship

**DY Shipping out partials**
- MSC and Grainger Drop Ship


- Not in compliance with Amazon (Tony and Evan are working with Amazon)
    - Very specific compliance regulations, packing and box sizes etc..

 

# For me to do

- Add in private notes when sales requests a partial shipment
    - no action, just update process for adjusting sales POs for a partial shipment

- Sales flooding recieving with priorities
    - figure out how to deal with that
    - work with Trish to figure out  

    - **routing through me now**
