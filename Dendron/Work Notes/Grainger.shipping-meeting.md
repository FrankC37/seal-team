#### Change
- Status line on the w/inv count for grainger metrics ( picked or packed = status), will elminate some extra clicks

- Figure out how we can make bins work in these reports  

- Look at the bin for reallocations, perhaps adjust the reallocate report


#### Grainger Drop Ship


1. Backlog w/ Inv - Access Template


Items Pending Fulfillment

vs

W_Items Pending Fulfillment



### Prefered Bins

- Report to find all items with no preffered bin, then set preffered bin


### Access Issues

- Not printing the right report (AKA not formatted for access template)


### Partial Shipments

- Not able to ship a partial from multiple locations (without Tonys help)
